    "text": "Research Question\nThis week’s TidyTuesday brings insights into Brazil’s companies, curated by Marcelo Silva with data from Brazil’s open CNPJ and the Brazilian Ministry of Finance. For the assignment’s purposes, I will focus on the following research question: What distinguishes Brazil’s highest-capitalized companies from typical firms, and how do legal structure, ownership type, and formal size classifications shape access to significant capital?\nData Import\n\nCodeinstall.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org/\")\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/69/qbkys82d1qn4bxh5ts_647d40000gn/T//RtmpdyZRvl/downloaded_packages\n\nCodetuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2026-01-27')\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncompanies &lt;- tuesdata$companies\nlegal_nature &lt;- tuesdata$legal_nature\nqualifications &lt;- tuesdata$qualifications\nsize &lt;- tuesdata$size\n\n\nVisualizations\n\nCode# Data wrangling\ncompanies_clean &lt;- companies %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(capital_stock), !is.na(company_size), capital_stock &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elite_threshold = quantile(capital_stock, 0.90),\n    is_elite = capital_stock &gt;= elite_threshold\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Get top 5 legal natures\n  add_count(legal_nature, name = \"legal_count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(legal_simple = if_else(\n    legal_count &gt;= sort(unique(legal_count), decreasing = TRUE)[5],\n    legal_nature,\n    \"Other\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(companies_clean, aes(x = company_size, y = capital_stock, color = legal_simple)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = elite_threshold), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Capital Stock Across Company Sizes\",\n    subtitle = \"Red line marks the top 10% threshold\",\n    x = \"Company Size\",\n    y = \"Capital Stock (BRL, log scale)\",\n    color = \"Legal Nature\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Data wrangling\nowner_comparison &lt;- companies %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(owner_qualification), !is.na(capital_stock), capital_stock &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elite_threshold = quantile(capital_stock, 0.90),\n    is_elite = if_else(capital_stock &gt;= elite_threshold, \"Elite (Top 10%)\", \"Other Companies\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Get top 5 owner qualifications\n  add_count(owner_qualification, name = \"owner_count\") %&gt;%\n  filter(owner_count &gt;= sort(unique(owner_count), decreasing = TRUE)[5]) %&gt;%\n  group_by(owner_qualification, is_elite) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(is_elite) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\nggplot(owner_comparison, aes(x = reorder(owner_qualification, percent), y = percent, fill = is_elite)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Who Controls the Capital?\",\n    subtitle = \"Owner qualification patterns in elite vs. typical Brazilian companies\",\n    x = \"Owner Qualification\",\n    y = \"Percentage (%)\",\n    fill = \"Company Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Findings\nWho controls the capital in Brazilian business?\nBrazil’s CNPJ registry tracks millions of companies, including their capital stock (declared share capital). We can understand who controls significant financial resources in Latin America’s largest economy. By examining the “capital elite” (top 10% by capital stock, above R$3930456).\nDoes size matter for these businesses?\nOur first visualization shows an interesting pattern: formal size classifications are nearly meaningless. Companies labeled “micro-enterprises” can have capital stock exceeding R$1 billion, often more than many “small-enterprises.” The elite threshold (red line) cuts across all size categories, showing that Brazil’s administrative labels don’t reflect economic reality.\nHowever, Legal structure does matter. Limited Liability Business Companies dominate the high-capital tier, suggesting certain legal forms provide better access to serious investment.\nWhat about ownership?\nWhile Managing Partners control 79% of typical Brazilian firms, elite companies show much greater diversity in leadership. Administrators and Managers lead 30.5% of elite companies but only 8.7% of typical firms. Directors, Officers, and Presidents are also far more common at the top, suggesting that high-capital firms adopt more formalized corporate governance structures rather than the partnership model that dominates smaller enterprises.\nSo, what does that mean?\nAccess to capital in Brazil isn’t just about business ideas. It’s about structure. Formal size classifications may misdirect policy support, while legal form and ownership type systematically advantage certain organizational arrangements. For entrepreneurs seeking investment, these aren’t just administrative choices. They’re strategic decisions with real consequences for accessing the capital that fuels growth.",
